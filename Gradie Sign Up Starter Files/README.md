# Gradie sign up page

This is my first project. I used the frontend mentor for this. this is a sign up page to the gradie site. I built the desktop, tablet and mobile view with HTML & CSS.

I deployed my project using the following websites:

- [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/Nnamdi84/Gradie-Sign-up-page.git)

They're super easy to setup and I hhave my website up and running in no time.
